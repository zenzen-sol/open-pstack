# open-pstack technical reference

This page contains the full skill, dependency, runtime, and porting reference. For the plain-English introduction and quick start, see the [main README](../README.md).

[Poteto](https://x.com/poteto)'s [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), adapted to run in Claude Code and Codex without Cursor. One shared skill tree serves both harnesses; Grok remains available as a model-provider lane. Version 1.4.2-maana.1 is synced to Cursor pstack v0.15.1 at `f8abeddd1862dc73704e3d719dd73df0d51b8c71`. See [UPSTREAM.md](../UPSTREAM.md) for the exact sync contract.

Original by Lauren Tan. This distribution builds on Michael Denyer's [pstack-claude](https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude) port and retains its history and MIT attribution. It imports seven MIT-licensed skills from [cursor-team-kit](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/cursor-team-kit): `deslop`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `fix-ci`, `fix-merge-conflicts`, `get-pr-comments`, `what-did-i-get-done`.

> if you want to go fast, go deep first. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code. rigorous agent workflows you can parallelize with confidence.

This is not a verbatim copy. Skill bodies have been edited so every Cursor-specific primitive resolves to its Claude Code or Codex equivalent — see [Differences from upstream](#differences-from-upstream) for the full list. The exhaustive per-skill audit lives in [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md); license attribution lives in [NOTICE.md](../NOTICE.md); the upstream README is preserved verbatim at [README-UPSTREAM.md](../README-UPSTREAM.md).

## Install

### Claude Code

This repo ships as a Claude Code marketplace containing one plugin (`pstack`).

```text
/plugin marketplace add zenzen-sol/open-pstack
/plugin install pstack@open-pstack
/reload-plugins
```

The plugin auto-fires through a `SessionStart` hook on startup, `/clear`, and post-compact. The hook injects a small mandate that routes non-trivial engineering work into `poteto-mode`; the full skill loads only when invoked. Dispatched subagents ignore the mandate, and explicit user instructions take precedence. To opt out, delete `hooks/hooks.json` from the installed copy at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/open-pstack/pstack/<version>/hooks/hooks.json`; a plugin update restores it.

### Codex

The same plugin carries a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and a root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Install it through the Codex marketplace:

```shell
codex plugin marketplace add zenzen-sol/open-pstack --ref main
codex plugin add pstack@open-pstack
```

Codex discovers the plugin skills under the `pstack` namespace, so they list as `pstack:poteto-mode`, `pstack:tdd`, and so on. The namespace comes from `plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. To enable the multi-model and parallel-subagent skills (`interrogate`, `arena`, `how`, `why`, `reflect`, `architect`), turn on subagents in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

For local plugin development, you can clone the repository and link its skills directly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zenzen-sol/open-pstack
cd open-pstack
for s in plugins/pstack/skills/*/; do ln -s "$PWD/$s" ~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$s")"; done
```

The marketplace install is the normal user path. Direct links are only for testing a checkout before publishing it. Remove the linked skill directories when the test is over.

Plugin-internal `skills/<name>/` path references in the docs below are relative to `plugins/pstack/`.

## Running on Codex

The Codex build shares one `skills/` tree with the Claude Code build. Nothing is forked or generated. Two narrow references keep runtime translation separate: `codex-tools.md` maps harness primitives and `provider-dispatch.md` maps model providers. pstack otherwise keeps the upstream Claude-native prose and adds a one-line Platform note to each skill that names a Claude primitive, so the port stays in lockstep with upstream sync.

- **Skill invocation.** Codex loads `SKILL.md` natively. There is no `Skill` tool. You invoke a skill by name (ask for it, or pick `pstack:poteto-mode` from the list).
- **Package surface.** The native `skills/` tree is the only workflow source. The plugin ships no `commands/` layer and does not link prompts into `~/.codex/prompts/`. Codex would migrate such files into duplicate source-command skills while loading the native skill tree. The 23 `principle-*` leaves declare `user-invocable: false`. Claude keeps them out of its user picker; Codex 0.149.0 currently shows them despite that metadata ([#8](https://github.com/ericlitman/open-pstack/issues/8)).
- **Tool and built-in mapping.** Claude tool names and built-in skills resolve through [`codex-tools.md`](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md). Model execution resolves separately through [`provider-dispatch.md`](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md), so Codex can keep Codex families native while invoking Claude and Grok externally.
- **Subagents.** The `Agent` tool maps to Codex `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent`, enabled by `multi_agent = true`. Parallel fan-out is multiple `spawn_agent` calls in one turn. If the native Codex lane is unavailable, record that lane as a dropout; external Claude and Grok lanes still run, and no provider is silently substituted. There is no `poteto-agent` subagent type on Codex; route ad-hoc subagents by dispatching a `spawn_agent` told to read `poteto-mode` first.
- **Auto-fire.** The `hooks/` SessionStart injection is Claude Code-only; Codex has no plugin hook runtime. Enter `pstack:poteto-mode` by name, or add a standing instruction to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` if you want the same always-on routing.
- **Models.** `/setup-pstack` supports Fable, GPT-5.6 Sol, Grok 4.6, Opus, Sonnet, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6 Luna, GPT-5.6 Terra, GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6 Luna. It writes provider-qualified descriptors and asks one requested effort per active family (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). The role map is the only persisted source of active membership. Setup derives its target set from that map, probes and smokes only that set, and requires every selected family to appear in at least one role. The first-run panel remains Fable max, GPT-5.6 Sol max, Grok xhigh, and Opus xhigh. Fable, Opus, and Sonnet use Claude's rolling aliases. Runtime dispatch normalizes older versioned descriptors in memory, so an installed sheet stops pinning immediately. A setup rerun persists that migration. If neither normalization nor an operator choice changes the render, setup preserves the sheet and integration bytes exactly. In Codex, every Codex family uses native `spawn_agent`; Claude and Grok use the deterministic external runner. In Claude Code, Fable, Opus, and Sonnet use native agents; Codex and Grok use the runner. Children never detect the parent or reroute themselves. The `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, and `hillclimb` first-run roles stay on GPT-5.6 Sol max instead of upstream's Fable default because Sol costs less for these frequent delegated code roles.

Verified in fresh installed Claude Code and Codex sessions: the user-facing skills are discovered and namespaced under `pstack`; both parents fan out the frontier quad through the documented native/external route table, retain long-running handles without a default timeout, and cross-judge only after every candidate is terminal. The `principle-*` leaves remain available for `poteto-mode` to read by path. Claude honors their `user-invocable: false` metadata; Codex 0.149.0 does not ([#8](https://github.com/ericlitman/open-pstack/issues/8)).

## Dependencies

Nothing is declared in `plugin.json`. Install the one companion plugin yourself:

- **`plugin-dev`** (from the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace) — the rewiring routes skill-authoring tasks (in `automate-me`, `reflect`, `poteto-mode`) to the `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill:

  ```shell
  /plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
  /plugin install plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official
  ```

  Until 0.9.2 this was a `dependencies` entry in `plugin.json`. The desktop app's `--plugin-dir` load mode can never resolve cross-marketplace dependencies and hard-disables the whole plugin, so 0.9.3 removed the declaration — full mechanism in the 0.9.3 entry of [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md). Without `plugin-dev` installed, only the skill-authoring routes degrade; everything else works.

Not declared as deps, but referenced in skill bodies:

- **`run`, `verify`, `loop`** — Claude Code CLI built-ins (ship with the binary, always available).
- **`gh` (GitHub CLI).** This is the default forge for every stack playbook and a system-level requirement of the standalone `babysit` skill. Install it with [`brew install gh`](https://cli.github.com) and authenticate with `gh auth login`. If Origin's `origin` CLI is installed and can resolve the repository, the stack playbooks use it instead. Only the Orchestrate playbook and its `scripts/orch` frontier tooling still require `gt`.
- **`bun`** — runs the vendored `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/` tooling (`watch-pr`, `orch`, `runner`). Install via [`brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`](https://bun.sh). `bootstrap.ts` installs dependencies for `watch-pr` and `orch`; the runner uses only Bun and Node built-ins, so it launches directly without an install/re-exec layer.
- **`node`** — runs `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.mjs`. The checker uses only Node built-ins and does not need Bun.
- **Claude Code, Codex, and Grok Build CLIs** — the external runner uses the assigned subscribed CLI directly. Install and authenticate only the providers present in your model sheet. Same-provider work stays native; the runner refuses it.
- **`jq` and `rg` (ripgrep)** — only for `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (the Worktree cleanup playbook). Without them the audit still runs but blanks its PR and LAST_CHAT columns, so it warns on stderr rather than returning a table that looks complete.

No third-party plugins. The harsher-critique escape hatch lives in the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill (imported from cursor-team-kit), not in an external plugin.

## Skills

The table uses the short upstream names. Claude Code exposes each native skill with a `/pstack:` prefix, such as `/pstack:poteto-mode`. In Codex, ask for the namespaced skill, such as `pstack:poteto-mode`.

| skill | use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `/poteto-mode` | default entry point for any non-trivial task |
| `/how` | walk through how a subsystem works |
| `/why` | investigate why something was built this way (parallel multi-MCP evidence) |
| `/architect` | settle types and module shape before writing code that crosses a function boundary |
| `/arena` | run N parallel attempts at the same task and pick the best parts |
| `/interrogate` | have four different models try to break a diff |
| `/automate-me` | draft your own personal -mode skill from recent transcripts |
| `/reflect` | capture a long task's lessons as a skill edit |
| `/tdd` | fix a bug by writing the failing test first, then the fix |
| `/typescript-best-practices` | ground type-system discipline in TypeScript syntax |
| `/teach` | understand a change or subsystem for real: `how` + `why` woven into one plain explanation |
| `/swarm` | fan out N parallel workers across slices or races, then one aggregated report |
| `/technical-writing` | write docs, RFCs, readmes, PR descriptions, and commit messages to one layered standard |
| `/bro` | restate the last message in plain human language, no jargon |
| `/figure-it-out` | design a rigorous, auditable playbook for a task no bundled playbook fits |
| `/show-me-your-work` | log decisions to a reviewable tsv decision trail |
| `/blast-radius` | find what a change could break beyond the diff and prove safety by running code |
| `/recall` | catch up on recent working context from chat history, live state, and the shared record |
| `/setup-pstack` | configure pstack per-role model choices and per-family requested effort |
| `/unslop` | clean up writing by removing AI tells |
| `/no-comments` | strip comments before review via the `comment-sicko` subagent, then fix what it finds |
| `/create-verification-skill` | generate a project-local verification skill and feature map |
| `/maintain-verification-skill` | re-sync a drifted verification skill and its feature map |
| `/deslop` | deslop a diff before commit |
| `/babysit` | monitor an open PR, fix CI/comments, keep it merge-ready |
| `/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` | extremely strict maintainability audit |
| `/make-pr-easy-to-review` | clean noisy history and improve PR description before review |
| `/fix-ci` | find failing PR checks, inspect logs, apply focused fixes |
| `/fix-merge-conflicts` | non-interactively resolve merge conflicts, validate, finalize |
| `/get-pr-comments` | fetch and summarize review comments from the active PR |
| `/what-did-i-get-done` | summarize authored commits over a user-chosen period |

## Subagents

`poteto-agent` ships unchanged. Spawn from a parent with `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`.

`comment-sicko` is the read-only comment reviewer the `no-comments` skill spawns. Upstream names it `Comment Sicko`; the port renames it to `comment-sicko` so the name is a valid `subagent_type`. Invoke it through `/no-comments`, not directly.

Fable and Opus each ship at `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. Names are `pstack-<stem>-<effort>`. `pstack-fable-max` and `pstack-opus-xhigh` remain. Each file selects the rolling family alias and requested effort, runs in the background, and denies nested Agent/Task dispatch. pstack dispatches them from provider-qualified descriptors; they are not user-facing workflows.

## Differences from upstream

The port is editorial, not mechanical. Anywhere upstream pstack assumed Cursor-specific primitives, this port substitutes the Claude Code equivalent so refs actually resolve. Two prior ports ([v1truv1us/ai-eng-system](https://github.com/v1truv1us/ai-eng-system), [Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet](https://github.com/Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet)) stop at namespacing — they vendor pstack under `pstack/` and leave the Cursor refs intact. This port does the content surgery.

### What's added

- **`skills/babysit/`** — Claude Code analog of Cursor's closed-source `/babysit` built-in. Wraps `gh pr view` / `gh pr checks` / `gh run view --log-failed` plus the `loop` skill for pacing. Independently authored; workflow informed by Cursor's public `/babysit` behavior — not a copy of Cursor's implementation. Since the v0.14.2 sync, poteto-mode routes PR-status requests to the ported `playbooks/babysit.md` instead, and this skill is the standalone `/babysit` entry point.
- **`skills/deslop/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Cleans AI tells out of diffs before commit.
- **`skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`.
- **`skills/make-pr-easy-to-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Composes with `opening-a-pr` and `babysit`.
- **`skills/fix-ci/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Narrower CI-fix primitive that `babysit` can route to.
- **`skills/fix-merge-conflicts/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Pairs with `babysit` step 5.
- **`skills/get-pr-comments/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Primitive for `babysit` step 4 and `reflect`.
- **`skills/what-did-i-get-done/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Commit summary over a chosen period.

### What's substituted in skill bodies

| Upstream (Cursor) | This port (Claude Code) |
| --- | --- |
| `Task` tool, `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `readonly: false/true` | `Agent` tool with model selection, requested effort, and `disallowedTools`; access mode is assigned by the parent, with writers isolated in worktrees |
| `AskQuestion` tool | `AskUserQuestion` tool |
| Cursor's built-in `/loop` | Claude Code's built-in `loop` skill |
| Cursor's built-in `/babysit` | `babysit` skill bundled in this plugin. From v0.14.0 upstream routes PR-status requests inside poteto-mode to `playbooks/babysit.md` instead; the port does the same, and `/babysit` stays the standalone entry point |
| Cursor's built-in `/create-skill` | `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-cli` (CLI/TUI driver) | Claude Code's `run` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-ui` (browser/Electron driver) | Claude Code's `verify` skill |
| Transcripts at `~/.cursor/projects/*/` or `agent-transcripts/` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` (where `<encoded-cwd>` is the workspace cwd with `/` → `-`) |
| Skill paths `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/plugins/` | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/` |
| MCP discovery via Cursor's `mcps/` directory | Tool list at top of system prompt (`mcp__<server>__<name>` entries), or `.mcp.json`, or `claude mcp list` |
| Cursor cloud agents (`environment: "cloud"`, `cloud_base_branch`) | Local background subagents (`run_in_background: true`), isolated by git worktree |
| Cursor's `/goal` (standing objective across turns) | The program objective written into the run's standing orders and restated in the todolist |
| The Cursor agent store (path in the system prompt) | `~/.claude/orchestrate/<project-slug>/`, which survives the session restarts a multi-day program expects |
| Model rule `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` | Override sheet `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, included from `CLAUDE.md` |
| Multi-model panels (arena, architect, interrogate) | Provider dispatch restores the upstream frontier quad: `claude:fable@max`, `codex:gpt-5.6-sol@max`, `grok:grok-4.6@xhigh`, `claude:opus@xhigh`. Same-provider lanes stay native; external lanes use the bundled runner. |

### Cross-vendor dispatch

The earlier port collapsed panels to Claude-only models. The bundled runner restores upstream's cross-provider judgment signal without adding a daemon or model-router service. Claude Code shells out to Codex and Grok; Codex shells out to Claude and Grok. The top-level parent chooses every route and each external process receives a complete task directly, so there is no supervising model invocation and no child-side harness detection.

### What's deliberately kept

- The `poteto-agent` subagent ID and all references to it.
- `run_in_background: true` on Agent calls (Claude Code supports it).
- `/loop`, `/deslop`, `/babysit` slash references in skill bodies — they all resolve in Claude Code now.
- The principle/playbook structure and upstream principle prose, except the local correctness edits in `principle-attack-the-premise` and `principle-test-behavior-not-implementation`.

### What's deliberately not ported

- **`automations/benny/`** (upstream `0452e08`, the only pstack change between `e46364b` and v0.10.0) — a dormant Slack issue-triage and reproduce-and-fix automation pack built on Cursor's event-triggered automations. It registers no slash skills even upstream, so excluding it changes nothing about the ported plugin's behavior. Porting it would require Cursor's event-trigger runtime, Slack, and tracker plumbing that Open Pstack does not provide.
- **`docs/guide/`** (upstream `02c03a9`, `0b7ef5b`, `424829e`) — the ten-chapter usage tutorial and its six screenshots (2.3 MB). It teaches pstack through Cursor's UI, sticky mode, and cloud agents, so a faithful port would be a rewrite rather than a sync, and none of it ships as skill content. Read it upstream at [cursor/plugins/pstack/docs/guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/docs/guide); the concepts map through the substitution table above.
- **`make-bot-ui`** (upstream `799151d`, relocated by `6fecddb`) uses Cursor routines, webhook events, hosted bot state, and Cursor UI primitives that have no shared Claude Code and Codex mapping. A provider-specific rewrite would be a separate feature, not an upstream sync.
- **Fable solo code defaults** (upstream `23a56e2`) move `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, and `hillclimb` from GPT-5.6 Sol to Fable. Open Pstack keeps these frequent delegated code roles on `codex:gpt-5.6-sol@max` because Fable costs much more per task.
- **Sticky mode** (upstream `#144`) — Cursor-only `mode`/`icon`/`color`/`reminder` frontmatter with no Claude Code equivalent. The port's 0.9.5 SessionStart hook is the analog and already carries the non-trivial / trivial / opt-out logic.
- **`is_background: true` on `poteto-agent`** (upstream `99559f2`) — Cursor names this key differently. Claude-native frontier definitions use `background: true`; ad-hoc `poteto-agent` calls remain background dispatches at the call site.
- **`cursor-team-kit` beyond the seven imported skills** — the rest either duplicate Claude Code built-ins (`verify-this` → the `verify` skill and built-in verification discipline; `check-compiler-errors` → LSP diagnostics; `control-cli`/`control-ui` → `run`/`verify`, already the substitution targets) or overlap skills this port ships (`loop-on-ci`, `review-and-ship`, `weekly-review` vs `babysit`, `fix-ci`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `what-did-i-get-done`). `pr-review-canvas` is Cursor-UI-specific.

### Forking note

Editing skill bodies forks this from upstream. Re-syncing to a future pstack release means re-applying the substitution table. The full re-port recipe is in [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md).
